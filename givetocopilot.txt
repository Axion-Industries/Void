Hello! Nice to meet you! Can you analyze ALL of the code, files, folders, directorys, EVERYTHIGN. So you could get a good pictuer of it. Anyways, after you do that, edit the files for any errors or any errors that COULD potentially happen. I am hositng with render, and I have a nice UI, but it currently serves no purpose. Please connect it with the AI model that has parameters/knowledge. Simply make everything work. I have dropped below the UI files. Also btw i created these UI files somewhere else, so they are not connected to the api or anything in ANY way whatsoever, so please do your hardest do be sure itll work. My main goal for this was to make a nice UI (similar to chatgpt's), make everything work seamlessly, be able to train the model by SIMPLY just entering plain text (data) and bam, it gets trained, and lastly, to make money. There is going to be 4 main models, Z1, Z1 Pro, Z2, and XV.
